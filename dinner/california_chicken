Mix everything except the chicken in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a sealable container, add the chicken and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 4 hours, turning at least once.

Discard marinade and grill chicken uncovered, turning once, for 12 minutes or until internal temperatures reach at least 170°F. Remove from the grill and slice into bite-sized strips.

Serve warm with tortillas and grilled vegetables.
