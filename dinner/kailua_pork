Kailua Pork

2 pounds of pork shoulder roast
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 banana leaves
salt
hickory liquid smoke

Makes 8 servings of shredded pork.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut pork into 2″ cubes. Place half of chopped onion onto the banana leaves and lay pork on top; reserve the remaining onion for serving. Sprinkle pork liberally with salt and liquid smoke. Fold up banana leaves tightly, covering pork completely and securing with twine. Wrap tightly with two layers of aluminum foil.

Place foil package onto a baking pan and bake at an immediately reduced temperature of 300°F up to 6 hours, ensuring meat reaches an internal temperature of at least 145°F. Unwrap and shred pork using two forks, cover with foil and let stand for 10 minutes.

Serve with sweet onion, sea salt, a side of steamed white rice and mac salad.
