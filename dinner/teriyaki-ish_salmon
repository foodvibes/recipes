Teriyaki-ish Salmon

2 pounds of salmon
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup water
4 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons coconut vinegar
2 garlic cloves, minced

Makes two pounds of salmon.

Mix everything except the salmon in a small bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a sealable container, add the salmon and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Remove the salmon from the marinade and place into an oiled baking dish, skin side down. Drizzle with marinade and bake at 400°F for 15 minutes or until salmon is cooked through and marinade caramelized.

Serve with freshly chopped green onion and a side of steamed white rice.
