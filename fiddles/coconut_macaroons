Coconut Macaroons

2 egg whites
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups shredded coconut
¾ cup condensed milk

Makes 24 macaroons.

Beat egg whites with sugar and vanilla in a mixing bowl until thick and foamy and set aside. In another large bowl, combine the coconut with the condensed milk. Fold in the egg whites mixture previously set aside. Using a tablespoon, drop batter by the spoonful onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake in a pre-heated oven at 250°F for 30 minutes or until golden.

Let the macaroons cool completely and remove from the parchment paper.

Serve or store.
