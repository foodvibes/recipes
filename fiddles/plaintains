Plaintains

1 green plantain
coconut oil
¼ lime, juiced
salt

Makes a couple handfuls of chips.

Slice plantains cross-wise as thin as you can. Coat with oil and lay in a single layer on aluminum-foil-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with lime juice and sprinkle with salt. Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes, checking constantly and removing individual chips as needed to avoid burning.

Serve immediately or store once cooled.
