Fries

coconut oil
2 pounds russet potatoes, sliced
salt
pepper

Makes six servings of fries.

Bring a couple inches of oil to 300Â°F in a large pot. Add the potatoes to the oil in batches, ensuring potatoes are fully submerged, cooking for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove each batch from the oil, place on a newspaper-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Serve warm with a side of fancy sauce.
