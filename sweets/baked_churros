Baked Churros

2 teaspoon cinnamon
½ cup sugar
¾ cup butter
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1 cup flour
3 eggs
½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Makes 12 churros.

Mix cinnamon and sugar in a rectangular baking pan or container and set aside. Combine ½ cup of butter, salt and water in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Pour mixture into a mixing bowl and add flour. Mix until incorporated, then slowly mix in eggs individually and finally mix in the vanilla. Spoon batter into a pastry bag with ½″ star tip and pipe into 6″ logs with 1″ spacing between rows onto a buttered baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven at 325°F for 30 minutes or until golden brown.

Melt the remaining ¼ cup of butter and brush each churro liberally then quickly roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until completely covered.

Serve warm alone or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
