Bake about ¼ cup of the coconut on a baking sheet at 350°F for five minutes or until golden brown. Set aside. Combine the half and half, eggs, sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and add the ¾ cup un-toasted coconut and vanilla. Pour into pie crust and refrigerate for four hours or until cool.

Top with a layer of whipped cream and sprinkle evenly with toasted coconut.

Serve chilled.
